# ðŸ¤ž goodluck

A template for creating small and fast browser games.

## Getting Started

_goodluck_ is not a typical library. It's not suitable for installing via
`npm install`. Instead, use it as a template: clone it into a new repo,
remove features you don't need, and hack away.

1. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/piesku/goodluck/generate)
   using _goodluck_ as a template.
2. Clone the newly created repository.
3. `npm install` the build tools.
4. `npm start` the development server.

Production builds are bundled into a single `.js` file and optimized for
size. You can find them in `public/opt`.

5. `npm run build`

## Design Principles

_goodluck_ is a template for creating small browser games. Apart from the
game loop and the rendering pipeline, _goodluck_ doesn't give you much more
code. We like to think of _goodluck_ as a set of good practices, architecture
decisions, and tools.

1. Keep the scope small. Always start with the MVP version of each feature.

2. Write code just for this game. Your goal is to ship a game, not build an
   engine.

3. Write data-driven procedural code. Keep a strict separation between data
   (components) and logic (systems). Forgo object-oriented concepts like
   inheritance and polymorphism.

4. Prefer simple code. Write code that can be easily understood and reasoned
   about. Always measure the performance impact of new code.

## Tech Overview

_goodluck_ implements the entity-component-system (ECS) architecture:

1.  _Entities_ are indices into arrays storing component data. Furthermore, a
    special array called `world` stores masks defining which components are
    enabled for which entities. Component masks are implemented using
    bitflags, which limits the total number of available components to 32.
    This should still be plenty for small and even medium-sized games.

2.  _Components_ are simple objects storing data, and only data. No logic goes
    into components. Each component defines an interface describing its data.

3.  _Systems_ store the game logic which runs for entities which have certain
    components enabled. Systems are executed either in `fixed_update` (guaranteed
    to run with the delta of 16 ms), or in `frame_update` which runs once per
    animation frame, as menaged by the browser.

_goodluck_ is written in TypeScript, but it only uses a small subset of its
features. The goal is to take advantage of the typing system and excellent
editor support, while reducing any overhead in the final build. Hence, most
features are strictly compile-only: they compile to zero bytes of JavaScript.

-   Interfaces describe the shapes of components. The data is then stored in
    plain object literals matching these shapes.

-   `const enums` act as non-iterable `enums`. They are replaced by their
    number value during compilation.

-   `type` aliases offer a way to create discriminated type unions. A closed
    typed system works well for _goodluck_ because the code is only written with
    the current project in mind, and you have the total control over all types
    used across the project.
